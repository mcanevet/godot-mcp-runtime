# Tool Authoring Standards

Standards for adding or modifying MCP tools in `godot-mcp-runtime`. Every tool ships on every client handshake — its description, schema, and annotations are the entire interface an LLM agent has to work with. Treat them like a UI, not an API doc.

If you change anything in `src/tools/*.ts`, work this checklist.

---

## 1. Description requirements

Every tool description states, in this order:

1. **Purpose** — what the tool does, in one sentence, in the agent's vocabulary (the outcome it achieves), not the implementation.
2. **Behavior** — non-obvious side effects. Especially: auto-save behavior, overwrite policy, what happens when the target doesn't exist.
3. **Parameter intent** — anything the schema can't express. Defaults, conditional requirements, parameter interactions, auto-conversions (e.g. Vector2/Color from `{x, y}` / `{r, g, b, a}`).
4. **Returns** — explicit return shape. A `Returns:` sentence in the description for the agent, and an `outputSchema` field for programmatic clients (see §3). The two are complementary, not substitutes.
5. **Use when / prefer X when** — when an agent should pick this tool over a sibling. Especially important when the server has multiple tools that touch the same resource.
6. **Error disclosure** — one short line per likely failure mode. "Errors if node not found." / "Overwrites silently." / "Returns empty array on no match."

### Description size budget

Soft cap **~500 characters per tool** including newlines. Every tool description ships on every handshake; bloat directly steals from the agent's context budget. If a description grows beyond this, pull background into a `# Notes` section in `docs/tools.md` and link.

### Examples in descriptions

Examples are useful but **contracts**: an example with two array items will produce two-item arrays. Use sparingly; if you must show one, make it minimal and not representative of common usage.

## 2. MCP annotations

Every tool definition includes an `annotations` object. Pick from:

| Annotation        | When to set                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readOnlyHint`    | `true` when the tool only reads state, never mutates files, project, or running process.                                                                  |
| `destructiveHint` | `true` when the tool removes or replaces something hard to recover.                                                                                       |
| `idempotentHint`  | `true` when calling N times with the same args produces the same result as calling once. Setters with absolute values, not appenders.                     |
| `openWorldHint`   | `true` when the tool reaches outside this server's domain (network, foreign filesystem, external service). Most tools here stay in-project — leave unset. |
| `title`           | Optional human-readable display name. Set when the tool name is awkward to read in client UIs; otherwise omit and the client falls back to the tool name. |

Defaults: omit annotations only if none apply. `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint` should be mutually exclusive.

Why this matters: clients ask for extra confirmation when a tool lacks a `readOnlyHint`. Setting these correctly improves the agent's experience without changing the tool itself.

## 3. `outputSchema` and `Returns:` — two audiences

These are complementary, not alternatives. They speak to different consumers and convey different things:

- **`outputSchema`** is the machine-readable contract for programmatic clients (validators, type generators, IDE tooling). JSON Schema, same shape as `inputSchema`. Top-level `type` must be `"object"` (MCP SDK constraint); bare-array or shape-variable returns omit it. Clients currently do not surface `outputSchema` to the LLM — it is invisible to the agent reading the tool.
- **`Returns:` sentence in the description** is the agent-facing summary. It names the key fields and adds what the schema can't express — when fields are present, what values imply, how the agent should use them. One short sentence; the description budget (§1) is tight.

When both are present, they must be consistent — same field names, same semantics — but the prose is not a verbatim transcription of the schema. Pure shape-transcription wastes bytes; semantic summary earns them.

When `outputSchema` is impractical (oneOf variants, bare-array, recursive trees, opaque values), the `Returns:` sentence is the only return-shape signal and carries the full load.

### `structuredContent` is mandatory when `outputSchema` is declared

MCP spec revision 2025-06-18: any tool that declares `outputSchema` must return a matching `structuredContent` field on success. Strict clients (LM Studio, Open Code, AnythingLLM) reject responses that omit it. Route success paths through `createStructuredResponse(payload, extraContent?)` from `src/utils/structured-response.ts` — it emits the payload both as a JSON text content block (for lenient clients) and as `structuredContent` (for strict clients). For headless GDScript ops whose script emits JSON, pass `{ parseStdoutAsJson: true }` as the options arg to `executeSceneOp` and the helper does the wrapping. The payload shape must match `outputSchema`; if you change one, change the other.

### Harness visibility — what the agent actually sees

Harnesses (Claude Code, MCP clients, etc.) inline `inputSchema` — including every per-property `description` — into the tool list the LLM reads. They typically **do not** inline `outputSchema`. This produces a useful asymmetry: per-property descriptions inside `inputSchema` are a high-value agent-facing surface, scoped to the field the agent is about to fill in.

When a tool is too complex to cover in the top-level description budget (~500 chars), push field-specific guidance into the per-property descriptions instead of expanding the top-level. Examples that earn their bytes there: the exact form a parameter expects (e.g. "Godot `KEY_*` constant name without prefix"), non-obvious defaults or asymmetries between sibling enum values, anchoring units with a benchmark ("~16ms = one frame at 60fps"), or coordinate-system conventions. The top-level description stays for the cross-cutting story; per-property descriptions cover the footguns.

## 4. Naming convention

**Verb plurality matches param cardinality.**

- Singular subject → singular verb: `add_node({ nodeType, nodeName, ... })`, `attach_script({ nodePath, scriptPath })`
- Array subject → plural verb: `set_node_properties({ updates: [...] })`, `delete_nodes({ nodePaths: [...] })`, `get_node_properties({ nodes: [...] })`

The `batch_` prefix is **not** a naming convention — it's the symptom of a missed consolidation (see §5). If you're tempted to add `batch_foo`, reconsider whether `foos` should take an array.

Use snake_case for tool names and the GDScript boundary; camelCase inside TypeScript. The `normalizeParameters` / `convertCamelToSnakeCase` helpers in `src/utils/parameter-conversion.ts` bridge them.

### Implementation helpers

Headless-op handlers (the ~15 in `src/tools/scene-tools.ts` and `src/tools/node-tools.ts`) wrap through `executeSceneOp` from `src/utils/headless-op.ts` for the execute + empty-stdout-check + try/catch shell. New headless-op handlers should follow the same shape — keep normalize/validate/build-params in the handler and let `executeSceneOp` own the runner call and error mapping.

## 5. Consolidation criteria

**Decompose by outcome, not by parity with the underlying API.**

| Situation                                                              | Pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same outcome, varying cardinality (set property on 1 node vs 50 nodes) | **One tool, array param.** `set_node_properties({ updates: [...] })`. An LLM passing a 1-element array is trivial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Different outcomes (delete a node vs duplicate a node)                 | **Separate tools.** Different verbs, different shapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Heterogeneous ordered operations on shared state in one process        | **One tool with per-item operation field is acceptable** if the discriminator is load-bearing — dropping it would force agents to chain N round-trips and lose the shared-state guarantee. `batch_scene_operations` is the documented exception in this server: the alternative (N singular calls) costs ~3s startup per call and loses the in-process scene cache. **Rare.** Never use as an escape hatch from designing per-outcome tools. |
| Read-only diagnostic that agents almost never need                     | **Drop it.** Don't keep low-value tools in the surface "in case." Every tool ships on every handshake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Discriminator antipattern: how to recognize it

If your tool's `inputSchema` has:

- A field whose enum value gates which other fields are required, AND
- The valid-params-per-enum-value relationship is documented in description text, not enforced by schema

…you have a discriminator antipattern. Agents can't reliably reason about which params are valid given which operation value, and conditional schemas double the validation surface. Either split into separate tools (preferred) or document why the discriminator is load-bearing and the cost of splitting (see `batch_scene_operations`).

## 6. Security policy for GDScript-executing tools

Any tool that forwards arbitrary GDScript to a running Godot process — `run_script` today, and any future sibling — MUST route the source through `evaluateScript(source, ctx.strictMode)` from `src/utils/run-script-policy.ts` **before** calling the bridge. The policy table is the single auditable surface; don't add inline regex checks in the handler, don't replicate the rule list in another module, and don't ship a new "trusted-script" shortcut that skips the gate.

For tools that launch a Godot project (`run_project`) or attach to one, the same module's helpers (`parseAutoloads`, `collectSceneScriptsRecursive`, `resolveLaunchScene`) drive the pre-flight scan over autoloads and the launched scene's scripts, recursing transitively into every PackedScene the scene instances. Findings flow into the response `warnings` array in non-strict mode; strict mode hard-rejects on Tier 1.

If you add a new GDScript-executing tool, also extend the test suite in `tests/unit/handlers/runtime-handlers.test.ts` with Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 / strict-mode coverage following the pattern there.

See `docs/security.md` for the full catalogue and tier rationale.

## 7. Pre-merge checklist

For any PR that adds or changes a tool definition:

- [ ] Description includes purpose, behavior, params intent, returns, "use when", error disclosure (§1)
- [ ] Description under ~500 chars (§1)
- [ ] `annotations` set correctly: `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` (§2)
- [ ] `outputSchema` present, OR description has explicit `Returns: { … }` line (§3)
- [ ] Tool name follows verb-plurality rule (§4); no new `batch_*` unless §5 exception applies
- [ ] Consolidation check: is there already a sibling tool with the same outcome at different cardinality? If so, fold (§5)
- [ ] If discriminator: documented as load-bearing exception with rationale (§5)
- [ ] `docs/tools.md` updated with the new/changed tool entry
- [ ] If breaking (rename, drop, schema change): migration table entry in CHANGELOG / release notes
- [ ] `npm run verify` passes (typecheck → lint → format:check → test → build)
